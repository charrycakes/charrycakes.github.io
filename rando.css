      <h2>All About me</h2>
  <h3><p style="color:pink;"> My favorite holiday is Christmas.
  It’s one of the only holidays my extended family gets together and can finally be a whole.
  It also falls on my grandpa’s birthday which makes it even more special for us.
  To the left, you can see a photo of my family from last Christmas in 2018.
  A couple years ago our grandma passed away, and in a way she was sort of the glue to our family.
  After her passing, family functions became dry, problems emerged and things happened.
  Christmas is one of those holidays where we get to forget our differences and just be blessed to be alive, together and healthy.
  Alongside that, we also play super fun games where you can win money so it gets hella heated and competitive.
  Don’t even get me started with the food. My aunties and uncles come together to put a bomb feast down.
  One of my favorite parts is when we all gather around the table to pray and say grace.
  It’s where I'm truly able to look around be blessed for everything I have including my family.</p></h3>
